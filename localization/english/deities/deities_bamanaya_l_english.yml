 omen_mangala_desc:0 "It is said that Mangala, the god of creation, once tried to create all of reality into one seed, and failed. Afterwards, he instead created two seeds (which some know as 'The Egg of the World in Two Twin Parts'). Then, he created three pairs of seeds; each pair representing an element, direction, or corner of the framework of the world. Finally came the last twin pair of seeds, called the egg-placenta of the world. From this seed pair would come the two twins who give rise to humanity."

 omen_pemba_desc:0 "The powerful Pemba tore through the placenta of his seed early, as he wished to dominate. Pemba would fall through space, and a piece of his placenta became the barren and desertous earth. When he realized that his arrival was premature, and the deserts useless, he tried to rejoin his twin in the egg, however, Mangala the Creator had already taken the remainder of the placenta and crafted it into the sun. Pemba would then steal male seeds from the clavicle of Mangala, planting it in the barren ground, resulting in red, impure seeds."

 omen_faro_desc:0 "The God-Goddess Faro is the most revered of the deities in Bamanaya. Because of the rash behavior of Pemba, Faro was sacrificed to atone. They were cut into 60 pieces, and where each piece fell, a tree was born. Mangala would recreate Faro in the form of a human, sending them down with four twin pairs of men and women, all created from the placenta of Faro. Then, once on an arc made from Faro's placenta, Sourakata would arive with a drum made from the sacrificed Faro's skull, striking it, and flooding all the lands, taking the impure seeds of Pemba with it, and leaving in its place only the pure lands of Faro."
